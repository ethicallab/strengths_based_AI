I’d also love to see a better integration of community support, maybe a feature for connecting with others who are working on similar goals.","Absolutely, I think it would be useful for universities to offer the Flourish app as a wellness tool. College life can be stressful, and having an accessible, user-friendly app focused on mindfulness, goal-setting, and emotional well-being could make a real difference for students. The app could be particularly helpful for students who might not feel comfortable seeking in-person counseling or who need a supplementary tool to manage stress. By offering it through the university, it could also signal a stronger commitment to supporting student wellness, which is so important in today’s fast-paced academic environment.",17,3,14,,,,,,,,,,flourish,
