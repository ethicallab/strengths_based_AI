We are asking you to take part in a research study being done by Dr. John Hunter at Chapman University. Being in this study is optional, but if you choose to be in the study, you will be asked you to respond to a variety of questions related to your well-being, your perception of yourself and others, your thoughts, and your emotions. You may also be asked to engage in activities that support your well-being. This will help us learn more about student well-being throughout a semester. 

NOTE: PLEASE DO NOT PROCEED IF YOU ARE UNDER THE AGE OF 18.

 

TIME INVOLVEMENT: The study will require you to fill out 4 short surveys over a 6-week period. First, you will fill out a baseline survey (~15 minutes). After two weeks, you will be asked to fill out another brief survey (~5 minutes). After four weeks, you will be asked to fill out another brief survey (~5 minutes). At the conclusion of the study, you will fill out a follow-up survey (~15 minutes).

   


RISKS AND BENEFITS: Some questions will ask you about your general mental health and well-being, which could cause some discomfort. You can exit the survey at any time. Your answers have nothing to do with your grade, and you will not be graded on your performance. A potential benefit is the opportunity to check in with your personal well-being and explore how completing Flourish activities can enhance your life and connections. After all, your mental health is just as important as (if not more important than) your academics. In addition, you will be contributing to broader public health research to better understand the experiences of students like you.



COMPENSATION: Upon completion of all four surveys, you will be compensated with one SONA credit. 



PRIVACY AND CONFIDENTIALITY: Participant identities will remain completely confidential in this study. We will not release your responses in any way that could identify you. Data will be compiled and summarized for academic publications, research briefs, or presentations in a way that does not allow your responses to be identifiable. The anonymized data will be deposited on the Open Science Framework repository and will be made available to the public who wish to re-analyze the data based on open science. As in any data collection, there is risk of breach of confidentiality, but we make every effort to keep your study data confidential and not share your personal information with anyone outside the research team.
