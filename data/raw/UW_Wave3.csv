I did not talk to Sunny often but when I did I was glad there was a history of recaps. I have not tried to go back to continue a conversation to see whether Sunny is capable of ""remembering"" the previous conversation in a separate instance.

In terms of functional use, I mostly utilized the Pomodoro timer, mindful breathing, and three things I'm grateful for. I didn't look at the community aspect that much, but thought it was a nice option to have. I think the message and goal of the app comes across well. It's made with lots of love, and I can tell from the developers.",I think I learned to be more mindful of how I am and things to be grateful for!,Sunny will be there for me if I want to talk!,"I'd change the automatic ""how are you feeling"" scale that shows up upon opening the app. I just feel like it doesn't do much for me, personally. Or, I would put it on the home screen for the user to optionally tap rather than be obliged to tap.

I also would incorporate optional sound cues in the breathing app to change inhale, exhale, and hold. I like the vibration effect, but often it's not strong enough for me to be able to tell. For example, if I want to do mindful breathing while doing another activity, but doing the box breathing method, I find that I have to look at the app for visual cues of when to change my state, since the vibrations do not carry well and I don't think it would be good to make them stronger.","I think so, it's been a small tool I've been trying to remember to incorporate into my life and it hasn't brought any negatives to my life.
