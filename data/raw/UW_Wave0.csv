What is this study about?

We are asking you to participate in this study as an undergraduate student at UW. We are conducting this study to evaluate the effectiveness of empirical-based interventions to promote mental health for undergraduate students and exploring what everyday factors and activities impact undergraduate students’ well-being. In particular, the United States is in a mental health and loneliness crisis, and young adults in the U.S. have experienced a sharp decline in happiness and increase in loneliness and stress. In this study, we are interested in investigating the effects of small, easy-to-do activities that may improve mental health.

What will you be asked to do?

If you choose to be in this study, we will ask you to complete the following activities:


	Complete an online pre-survey to learn more about you that takes about 15 minutes to complete.
	Complete biweekly activities, such as an online reflection questionnaire about how you have been feeling for the past two weeks, every other week over 4 weeks (2 times total). These biweekly activities are expected to take 5 minutes to 1 hour per week.
	Lastly, complete a final 15-minute post-survey asking about your experience during the study.


Why might you want, or not want, to participate?

Reasons you may want to participate:


	Learn about activities you can continue after this study is completed that may enhance your mental health.
	Gain more insight into your personal well-being and what activities and behaviors are related to it.
	Indirectly benefit by learning more about the research process by activily participating in it, which may be paritcularly helpful as a student in PSYCH 209: Research Methods in Psychology.


Reasons you may not want to participate:


	You may feel uncomfortable sharing how you are feeling week-to-week, and you may find some questions personal or sensitive.

	
		We will ask you questions such as “To what extent have you felt cheerful for the past two weeks?” and “How often have you been feeling nervous, anxious, or on edge?”
		You can choose not to answer any questions you don’t want to answer and can stop any study procedures at any time.
	
	
	You are unable to regularly complete the activities each week, although we will accept incomplete data.


Completing this study will give you extra credit for the Engagement Learning Objective in PSYCH 209 and count as one of the Engagement categories. This will be counted as part of one’s grade once the study is completed by the end of Week 9 (November 22). This compensation will be pro-rated and adjusted according to how much of the study participants complete. For example, if students only complete half of the study (4 weeks), then half of one of the Engagement categories will be counted, and students would still need to complete half of another Engagement category.



However, there is an alternative assignment to get the same extra credit if you would like to not participate in this study. The alternative assignment is to complete a biweekly assignment asking you to connect class content to news and research you see outside of class and school, and analyze how research is translated to non-academic audiences. If you would like more information about this assignment, please contact Dr. Wu at dcwu@uw.edu.

How will we protect the information you provide?

We will protect your confidentiality. While your name will never be connected to your data, we will store identifiable information, such as your email address, separate from the study data. Access to your identifying information will be limited to only members of the study team and any individuals from the UW or other agencies that may need to audit study records. Your email will only be used to send you reminders to complete the study activities. At study completion, we will delete records of your email address completely to anonymize your data.



The information that we obtain from you for this study might be used for future studies. We may remove anything that might identify you from the information. If we do so, the information may then be used for future research studies or given to another investigator without getting additional permission from you. 

Will you get to know your research results?

At the end of the study, we will share preliminary results from the research in the second to last week of classes. Complete results from the research will be shared once data analysis is complete. If you would like to be updated on the complete results, we will ask for your contact information in a survey SEPARATE from your study data.

Other information about this study.

Being in this study is voluntary. This means that you can refuse to sign up. It also means that if you do sign up, you can decide to stop being in the study at any time without penalty and will be compensated according to how much you have participated. If you decide to withdraw, please contact Dr. Wu at dcwu@uw.edu.



You will not have to pay anything directly to be in the study. But you will need to have a working phone and internet connection to complete the activities. Surveys can be completed either on your phone, computer, or tablet with a working internet connection.



If you have been injured or otherwise harmed by participating in this study, contact any TA or Dr. Wu at dcwu@uw.edu.



If you would like a copy of the consent form, please request a copy from a TA or Dr. Wu, and we can provide a copy for you as a “PDF” document. Most computers already have PDF viewer software installed, which will allow you to open, read, or print the consent form. The email we send you will include a link to PDF viewer software (such as Adobe Acrobat Reader) in case your computer doesn’t already have it. If you would prefer to receive a paper copy of the consent form at no cost to you, please contact Dr. Wu. A copy will also be available on the PSYCH 209 Canvas page.



You will receive credit towards the Engagement Learning Objective (LO13) for PSYCH 209 upon completion of this study. Specifically, participating in this study will count as one of the three required Engagement categories for the Engagement LO.


What can you do if you want more information?

Talk to the study team. We are here to help you understand the study. Please ask us any questions you may have, even about things that are not in this document. It is our responsibility to give you the information you need to make a decision and to give you time to think about whether or not you want to sign up.
