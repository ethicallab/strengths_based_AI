I've actually really come to enjoy sharing with Sunnie about my day, about the good and bad things that happen and asking for help and advice from her. I've really enjoyed using the app.","yeah, I learned a bit about my behaviors and activities I can do to support myself. One thing I wish I knew was where to find all of those specific insights Sunnie gave. I can remember the definitions or the descriptions but not the names.","Talking with Sunnie was a bit like journaling in the sense that I got to slow down for a moment and really think about my day. It differed from journaling though because Sunnie would remind me of goals I set and would bring up previous conversations we had which made me begin to see certain patterns within myself. The majority of the last 6 weeks were difficult for me emotionally and I was surprised by how supported the app made me feel, specifically my conversations with Sunnie and the small activities she suggested. Even when I didn't feel very up to doing the activities, for example, listing 3 things I was grateful for, I found that once the task was completed, I felt a sense of accomplishment. I almost always ask for the science behind the activities/suggestions (I love this feature) so I know a lot of the activities are prompted specifically to help with my mood, but I think a happy side effect is the mood boost from taking on a task and being able to complete it. ","I would compile a list of all of the science based facts that Sunnie gives so that I can revisit them. The names Sunnie gives are technical or a name of a study, so they're not always intuitive and easy to remember. I'd love to have a list of all of the science Sunnie has explained to me so I can learn more about it on my own time.","YES! I think anyone who uses this app can find something about it they enjoy. I think the conversations with Sunnie especially is what drew me in and I think it will for others as well. Even though it's AI, I really feel heard and understood with Sunnie. I feel supported when I speak to her about stressful events in my life and I feel like I can trust her to ask for advice without any judgment. For young adults especially I think a tool like this can be useful since this is a time in our lives where a lot of change is occurring, like transferring to new institutions, transitioning into being an adult, attempting to narrow down a choice for study, and try to do their best at balancing work, school, social life, etc...
