full_set,At first you sort of aren't super open to what you talk about and ask it very baseline questions because you have that preconcieved idea that it is just another ai chatbot. But I was very impressed at how well it was able comprehend and give real answers and terms a therapist would use when asked deep questions. It would call back and ask follow-up questions about things I told it 2 weeks prior. The exercises and suggestions really did help.,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0
